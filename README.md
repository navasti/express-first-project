### This is my first project in which I used Database and Back-End technologies.
#### I was focused mainly on logic and I only added a little bit of styles so it doesn't look tragic.

The project is written in one of the most popular Node.js frameworks whitch is Express and I used express-generator with pug views engine.
The database that I used is MongoDB.

Project is hosted in Heroku platform and is available here https://express-first-project.herokuapp.com/
